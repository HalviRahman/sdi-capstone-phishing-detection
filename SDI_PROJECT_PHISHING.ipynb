            "**1. Feature Selection:**\n",
            "\n",
            "AI, specifically machine learning algorithms, can identify the most relevant features (columns in the dataframe) that contribute most to distinguishing between legitimate and phishing URLs. This is achieved through techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or using feature importance from tree-based models. In the provided example, a Random Forest Classifier was used to rank features based on their importance scores. The top 10 important features were printed, offering insights into which characteristics of URLs are most indicative of phishing attempts.\n",

Feature Selection:**\\n\\nAI, specifically machine learning algorithms, can identify the most relevant features (columns in the dataframe) that contribute most to distinguishing between legitimate and phishing URLs. This is achieved through techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or using feature importance from tree-based models. In the provided example, a Random Forest Classifier was used to rank features based on their importance scores. The top 10 important features were printed, offering insights into which characteristics of URLs are most indicative of phishing attempts.\\n\\n**2. Prediction:**\\n\\nAI models, such as Random Forest Classifiers, can be trained on the dataset to predict whether a given URL is phishing or legitimate.

Filter the dataframe `df` based on the 'status' column to separate phishing and legitimate sites.\n2. Use the `seaborn` library to create the boxplot.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Filter the dataframe based on 'status'\nphishing_df = df[df['status'] == 'phishing']\nlegitimate_df = df[df['status'] == 'legitimate']\n\n# Create a boxplot for phishing and legitimate sites separately\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.boxplot(x='status', y='length_url', data=df)\nplt.title('Distribution of URL Length between Phishing and Legitimate Websites')\nplt.xlabel('Status')\nplt.ylabel('URL Length')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code will generate a boxplot that visually compares the distribution of `length_url` between phishing and legitimate websites. The x-axis represents the 'status' (phishing or legitimate), and the y-axis represents the 'length_url'. Each box represents the distribution of URL lengths for that category, providing insights into how URL lengths differ between the two types of websites.</>`\nFor troubleshooting, visit: https://python.langchain.com/docs/troubleshooting/errors/OUTPUT_PARSING_FAILURE ",
